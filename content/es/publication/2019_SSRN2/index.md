abstract: 
   The purpose of this paper is to explore the variables that drive video players' switching intention from traditional gaming to mobile gaming. Moreover, this paper intends to uncover whether mobile gaming is complemental or substitutable to traditional gaming. A human migration framework, the Push-Pull-Mooring, is adopted to the context of video game switching. A total of 340 valid samples were collected in Chinese video game forums. We applied an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, K-mean clustering, to find different video game player segments. We also applied Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to estimate linear regression models for the whole sample and the segments found.
