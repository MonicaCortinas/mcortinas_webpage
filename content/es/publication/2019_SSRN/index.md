abstract: Consumers are increasingly combining distribution channels, both between purchases and when completing the same purchase in the so-called omni-channel behavior. In this work, we identify this omni-channel behavior among the customers of a global company in the fast fashion sector. Through a multinomial logit model, we perform customer segmentation based on their behavior. In this segmentation, we consider the explanatory role not only of the individuals’ characteristics but also of the distribution services and each channel’s policies. Thus, we observe how the product’s accessibility in the store, the store’s purchasing ambiance and web accessibility are key features of the channels that explain the customers’ omni-channel behavior.
