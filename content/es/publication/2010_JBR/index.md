abstract: "This paper contributes to the knowledge of the impact of the multi-channel strategy by analyzing its effects on one key aspect of the behavior of financial services customers. We analyze the factors influencing the extent of multi-channel shopping. Using a customer database, the study estimates one latent class regression model to control for heterogeneity, finding that customers' acquisition of diverse financial products and services and the total number of financial services are antecedents of multi-channel behavior. The study contributes a new measure to better assess the level of multi-channel consumer behavior. "
