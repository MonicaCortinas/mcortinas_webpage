abstract: "The use of Virtual Assistants by businesses and consumers is increasing. The literature has studied the functional and cognitive performance of virtual assistants, but little is known about the impact of the emotional and hedonic performance of virtual assistants. Artificial intelligence allows these devices to interact with users not only functionally, but also by incorporating elements of emotional response. This paper will analyze the emotional communication of Virtual Assistants and their effect on users. For this purpose, a multi-method study will be carried out through an experiment in a laboratory with devices such as an eye-tracker, galvanic response ring, and electroencephalogram (EEG) and, on the other hand, the estimation of a structural model through declarative data obtained with a survey."
