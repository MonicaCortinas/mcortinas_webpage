The development of artificial intelligence is impacting heavily in fields such as the labor market, energy supply control systems, financial markets and also consumer decision-making and the way in which individuals relate to companies.

In this project we are working on the implications of the development of artificial intelligence for marketing and retailing, especially in the field of e-commerce.
