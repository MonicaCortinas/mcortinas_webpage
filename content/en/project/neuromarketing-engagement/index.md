In the fall of 2020, we start our collaboration on an ambitious and multidisciplinary project, the Emotional Films Project. Together with a team of people from very different fields, we are working on a new audiovisual format. In our case, in the next two years we will collaborate in measuring the response and engagement towards this new product.
