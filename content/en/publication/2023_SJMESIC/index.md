abstract: 
   "Purpose – This paper aims to understand how the perceived usefulness of voice assistants (VAs) is
affected by the perceived quality of the process (interaction) and the outcome (information). The authors
also aim to determine the extent to which the perceived usefulness of VAs improves the perceived
privacy associated with their use and increases users’ intention to continue using them. Consumer
technology innovativeness is included as a personal trait moderator, to compare the results between
tech and nontech innovators. For this purpose, the authors use the framework of the uses and
gratifications theory (U&GT).
Design/methodology/approach – A survey of 467 VA users was conducted and structural equation
modeling was used to analyze the data.
Findings – The authors identify two main determinants of the perceived usefulness of VAs that
influence users’ intention to continue using this technology, process quality and outcome quality. These
two factors influence the continued use of VAs in different ways depending on the technology
innovativeness of the consumers. The results show that tech innovators are oriented toward the
interactive experience, and therefore, mainly value the process quality. In addition, nontech innovators
are oriented toward a satisfactory response from VAs, and therefore, primarily value the outcome
quality. In addition, the positive effect of perceived usefulness on perceived privacy is higher for tech
innovators.
Originality/value – This study enhances the literature on the perceived usefulness of VAs within the
framework of U&GT. It identifies two antecedents (process quality and outcome quality) of perceived
usefulness and observes significant differences based on technological innovativeness."
