Review readability increases product sales and enhances the relationship between review informativeness and product sales. Multimedia richness, either from seller-created or buyer-created content, is positively associated with product sales. Extreme positive review valence enhances the relationship between review informativeness and product sales. As a product of the research process, the lexicons of video game attributes are developed."
