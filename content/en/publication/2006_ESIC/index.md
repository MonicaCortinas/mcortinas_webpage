abstract: "In this paper we use an Artificial Neural Network Model for the analysis of the brand choice problem in a high-penetration high-purchase fre- quency product category (ground coffee). Between other results, we find different impacts of the mar- keting instruments between alternatives and accu- mulative effects of simultaneous promotions in dif- ferent alternatives. Therefore the information pro- vided by this model is useful in helping the analyst complementing other classical models like the multinomial logit when these face problems in their initial assuptions."
