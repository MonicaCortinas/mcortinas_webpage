abstract = {The objective of our study is to analyze how regularity and frequency of purchase affect price and discount sensitivity in brand choice and purchase incidence. We estimate the indicators for regularity and frequency of purchase and include these two variables in the analysis of consumer purchase behavior. We verify whether a customer is more likely to take advantage of an in-store promotion at her usual store, or if a customer's frequency of visits to a supermarket affects her purchase/no purchase or purchase quantity decisions.},
