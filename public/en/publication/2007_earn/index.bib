abstract = {This study analyses the importance of extrinsic attributes in the customer's choice of the white asparagus category, paying special attention to the influence of the product's origin, particularly the designation of origin of asparagus from Navarra. An experiment was designed, which included 18 choice screens, with choices made with combinations of the attributes. The results are analysed using a logit multinomial model that allows evaluating the importance of the attributes. Due to a latent segmentation, heterogeneity is controlled and different customer segments are detected.},
