It investigates three key areas: (1) the effect of privacy-related press coverage on public sentiment and discussion volume; (2) the comparative negativity of privacy-focused conversations versus general conversations; and (3) the specific privacy-related topics that arise most frequently and their impact on sentiment and discussion volume. Design/methodology/approach – A dataset of 441,427 tweets mentioning Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2021 were collected. Privacy-related press coverage has also been monitored. Sentiment analysis was conducted using the dictionary-based software LIWC and VADER, whereas text mining packages in R were used to identify privacy-related issues. Findings – Negative privacy-related news significantly increases both negativity and volume in Twitter conversations, whereas positive news only boosts volume. Privacy-related tweets were notably more negative than general tweets. Specific keywords were found to either increase or decrease the sentiment and discussion volume. Additionally, a temporal evolution in sentiment, with general attitudes toward VAPAs becoming more positive, but privacy-specific discussions becoming more negative was observed. Originality/value – This research augments the existing online privacy literature by employing text mining methodologies to gauge consumer sentiments regarding privacy concerns linked to VAPAs, a topic currently underexplored. Furthermore, this research uniquely integrates established theories from privacy calculus and social contract theory to deepen our analysis.","tags":["Artificial Intelligence","VAPAs","e-commerce"],"title":"Voice-activated personal assistants and privacy concerns: a Twitter analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saavedra, Álvaro","Chocarro, Raquel","Mónica Cortiñas","Rubio, Natalia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1696291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696291200,"objectID":"74d4d24bbb1d99e23206654e37243c06","permalink":"https://monicacortinas.net/en/publication/2023_sjmesic/","publishdate":"2023-12-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/2023_sjmesic/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose – This paper aims to understand how the perceived usefulness of voice assistants (VAs) is affected by the perceived quality of the process (interaction) and the outcome (information). The authors also aim to determine the extent to which the perceived usefulness of VAs improves the perceived privacy associated with their use and increases users’ intention to continue using them. Consumer technology innovativeness is included as a personal trait moderator, to compare the results between tech and nontech innovators. For this purpose, the authors use the framework of the uses and gratifications theory (U\u0026GT). Design/methodology/approach – A survey of 467 VA users was conducted and structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Findings – The authors identify two main determinants of the perceived usefulness of VAs that influence users’ intention to continue using this technology, process quality and outcome quality. These two factors influence the continued use of VAs in different ways depending on the technology innovativeness of the consumers. The results show that tech innovators are oriented toward the interactive experience, and therefore, mainly value the process quality. In addition, nontech innovators are oriented toward a satisfactory response from VAs, and therefore, primarily value the outcome quality. In addition, the positive effect of perceived usefulness on perceived privacy is higher for tech innovators. Originality/value – This study enhances the literature on the perceived usefulness of VAs within the framework of U\u0026GT. It identifies two antecedents (process quality and outcome quality) of perceived usefulness and observes significant differences based on technological innovativeness.","tags":["Artificial Intelligence","VAPAs","e-commerce"],"title":"Impact of process and outcome quality on intention for continued use of voice assistants","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"En el computación afectiva, los profesionales y académicos de la interacción humanos-máquinas están buscando formas de medir la aceptación de nuevos productos emergentes que puedan interpretar y adaptarse a las emociones del usuario en tiempo real.

This paper studies the differences in attention to product images in the product area in e-commerce sites considering the effects of purchase stage and product category. Attention to product images on websites is measured using eye-tracking in two experiments with 58 students and 66 subjects, with four product categories and four purchase tasks in each one. Our results show that pictures, in general, attract attention first, before the product names and price information. Furthermore, images attract less total attention than textual information. Images attract less attention when they are not crucial for completing the task, such as when purchasing a determined product or when locating product tracking information. Younger people (less than 30) spend much less time viewing the product pictures than older age groups (50 or more). According to our results, e-retailers could improve their sites’ performance by adapting the products’ presentation to the purchase tasks and visitor characteristics.","tags":["customer journey","purchase task","eye-tracking","experimental design","omnichannel strategy","e-commerce"],"title":"Attention To Product Images In An Online Retailing Store: An Eye-Tracking Study Considering Consumer Goals And Type Of Product","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cai, Xiaowei","Cebollada, Javier","Mónica Cortiñas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1663632000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1663632000,"objectID":"099e56df7259389c0f212a6c9bdd5975","permalink":"https://monicacortinas.net/en/publication/2022_jrcs/","publishdate":"2022-09-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/2022_jrcs/","section":"publication","summary":"Highlights: Review informativeness fully mediated the influence of product description informativeness on product sales.

Six types of in-game goods are grouped into three categories: functional-based goods, probability-based goods, and ornamental-based goods. After acknowledging the heterogeneity of the categories, a conceptual framework is developed by conducting 21 in-depth interviews, from which it emerges that players purchase functional-based goods, probability-based goods, and ornamental-based goods for different motives and through the different behavioural processes. First, the purchase of functional-based goods is a strategy for entering the flow experience. Second, the purchase of probability-based goods is a compromise for purchase restrictions. Third, the purchase of ornamental goods is driven by the synergism of intrinsic motivations and exposure in the virtual world. Therefore, video game researchers should not treat in-game goods as a homogeneous concept. The findings also suggest that it is critically important for video game developers to strike a balance between the challenges of the gameplay and the skills of players because excessively raising (or lowering) the level of difficulty could pose a threat to the company’s sustainable profit.","tags":["Mobile gaming","Artificial intelligence"],"title":"A grounded theory approach to understanding in-game goods purchase","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cai, Xiaowei","Cebollada, Javier","Mónica Cortiñas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1639526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639526400,"objectID":"652b3d5efc88b550c3dd7b620e88f7e2","permalink":"https://monicacortinas.net/en/publication/2022_ijhcs/","publishdate":"2021-12-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/2022_ijhcs/","section":"publication","summary":"The flow theory has been widely applied to explain video game players' gaming and purchasing behaviour. However, due to the conceptual and empirical flaws of the current measurement instruments, researchers can hardly apply them to measure dispositional flow experience of adult video game players. In this research, we conceptualised flow experience and developed its measurement instrument in the video game context. To achieve these objectives, we conducted five phases with different participants in each of them: conceptualisation of the constructs and item generation (n = 13), expert judging (n = 5), pre-test (n = 96), initial development and validation (n = 289), and advanced development and validation (n = 593). We applied both qualitative and quantitative analysis to conceptualise and measure flow experience of video game players, including grounded theory and several statistical tools of latent variable modelling. We obtained a scale of 28-items that performs well in the first-order model. Moreover, we tested three hierarchical structure of flow experience: unidimensional model, independent antecedent model, and hierarchical antecedent model. Results show that hierarchical antecedent model is the best structure to represent flow experience. We named our scale Video Game Dispositional Flow Scale (VGDFS).","tags":["Mobile gaming","Artificial intelligence"],"title":"Self-report measure of dispositional flow experience in the video game context: Conceptualisation and scale development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaowei Cai","Mónica Cortiñas","Javier Cebollada"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1627344000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627344000,"objectID":"f8aec82f54a0b111ac253ae3d39e4929","permalink":"https://monicacortinas.net/en/publication/2021_ec/","publishdate":"2021-07-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/2021_ec/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper intends to uncover whether mobile gaming is complemental or substitutable to traditional gaming.

We also applied Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to estimate linear regression models for the whole sample and the identified segments. Results demonstrate that 7 of the 13 variables included in the conceptual model have a significant impact on the switching intention, which are Perceived expensiveness of traditional gaming(PE), Perceived flexibility of mobile gaming(PF), Perceived cost of lost benefits(PCLB), Perceived high performance of traditional gaming(PGP), Past traditional gaming experience(EXPT), Past mobile gaming experience(EXPM), and Ownership of hybrid consoles(OHC). Moreover, results from the clustering analysis show that there are two segments in our sample, labelled Unshakable stayer and Moderate intentional emigrant. Switching intention from traditional to mobile gaming is low across the whole sample, although there are differences between the segments. We conclude that traditional gaming is not being substituted by mobile gaming.

These implementations can be useful for helping teachers and students to solve both educational questions and routine tasks. This paper examines the factors that explain teachers’ acceptance of chatbots through the dimensions of the Technology Acceptance Model (perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use), its conversational design (use of social language and proactiveness), and the teachers’ age and digital skills. The data collection process included a pre-test and an online survey with four different types of chatbots. We analyse 225 responses of primary and secondary education teachers. The results show that the perceived easiness and perceived usefulness leads to greater acceptance of chatbots. As for the chatbots’ features, formal language by a chatbot leads to a higher intention of using them. These results can help in chatbot design and communication decisions, improving the acceptance of the educational community.","tags":["Chatbot","Education","Artificial intelligence"],"title":"Teachers’ attitudes towards chatbots in education: a technology acceptance model approach considering the effect of social language, bot proactiveness, and users’ characteristics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raquel Chocarro","Mónica Cortiñas","Gustavo Marcos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1585234800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585234800,"objectID":"ab0e9bb498acb5e3f30ac65435de326e","permalink":"https://monicacortinas.net/en/talk/2020_gkaedutech/","publishdate":"2020-03-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/talk/2020_gkaedutech/","section":"talk","summary":"En la actualidad, las Tecnologías de la Información y la Comunicación se utilizan en la vida cotidiana hasta el punto de que se han vuelto esenciales.

Es necesario que las personas desarrollen la competencia tecnológica y digital para avanzar científica y tecnológicamente en el mundo actual y futuro. En este entorno, la Inteligencia Artificial surge para permitir dejar en manos de las máquinas ciertas tareas que hacían los humanos. Por ejemplo, los asistentes online o chatbots, son programas informáticos que simulan conversaciones humanas a través de chats de texto para ayudar a los usuarios. En entornos de enseñanza, pueden ser muy útiles para automatizar procesos y consultas que ahorrarían tiempo y esfuerzo. El objetivo de esta investigación es examinar los factores que impulsan la intención del uso de los asistentes online que responden consultas a los profesores.

Nuestro segundo objetivo se centra en examinar el efecto moderador de determinadas características del usuario sobre la intención de uso de los asistentes. Para ello, 225 docentes de centros educativos respondieron un cuestionario ad hoc. Los resultados de un modelo de regresión muestran que hay tres determinantes de la intención de utilizar esta tecnología: la facilidad, la utilidad y el rendimiento percibidos.

Consumers are increasingly combining distribution channels, thus displaying so-called omni-channel behavior, both to complete a given purchase and between purchases. The authors make a distinction between omni-channel customers, who make use of distribution services in both channels and omni-channel users, who make partial use of the distribution services of one channel to support purchases in another. This paper aims to identify the omni-channel behavior among the customers of a global fast fashion retailer dealing in a wide range of apparel and clothing accessories. Design/methodology/approach. Using a multinomial logit model, the authors perform a customer segmentation based on observed omni-channel behavior, considering the explanatory roles of demographics, distribution service features and customer service policies across the different retail channels. Findings. The authors observe that the key retail channel features for explaining omni-channel customer behavior are product accessibility, both in store and online; the assurance that goods purchased online will satisfy the customer’s needs and expectations; and the option to return goods found unsatisfactory. Practical implications. The results clearly show that the nature of the visits and purchases made by customers is determined by various components of the companýs customer service policy, which can, therefore, be used to guide the retailer’s segmentation strategy.","tags":["customer journey","purchase task","omnichannel strategy","e-commerce"],"title":"Omni-channel users and omni-channel customers: a segmentation analysis using distribution services","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"El desarrollo de la inteligencia artificial está teniendo un impacto importantísimo en campos como el mercado laboral, los sistemas de control de suministro energético, los mercados financieros y también la toma de decisiones de consumo y la forma en la que los individuos se relacionan con las empresas.\nEn este proyecto estamos trabajando en desarrollar las implicaciones del desarrollo de la inteligencia artificial para el marketing y el retailing, especialmente en el ámbito del e-commerce.\nDos subproyectos en este ámbito en los que participo como Investigadora Principal están siendo financiados por la Agencia Estatal de Investigación:\n Proyecto Aimark 2020-2024 PID2019-108554RB-I00 financiado por MCIN/ AEI/10.13039/501100011033/ Proyecto INAVI 2022-2024 TED2021-129513B-C21 financiado por MCIN/ AEI/10.13039/501100011033/  ","date":1575590400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575590400,"objectID":"a903a8fd061907c9182a22fe4aed4729","permalink":"https://monicacortinas.net/en/project/artificial-intelligence/","publishdate":"2019-12-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/artificial-intelligence/","section":"project","summary":"Proyecto en curso sobre el impacto de la Inteligencia Artificial en el marketing.","tags":["Artificial Intelligence","Retailing","e-commerce","Recommendation bots","En curso"],"title":"Artificial Intelligence in Retailing","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mónica Cortiñas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1571830200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571830200,"objectID":"600b469649f9900b8f2ed77b016bac6b","permalink":"https://monicacortinas.net/en/talk/2019_mundo/","publishdate":"2019-10-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/talk/2019_mundo/","section":"talk","summary":"Charla en el marco de la jornada organizada por el Consejo Social de la UPNA: El mundo que viene (III).

Empirical results from K-mean clustering show that there are two types of players in our samples, who are Unshakable stayer and Moderate intentional emigrant. Additionally, according to one-tailed t test, switching intention from traditional video platforms to the mobile platforms in the Moderate intentional emigrant group is significantly higher than Unshakable stayer group. On the other hand, we also apply Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to estimate the lineal regression models for observations grouped by K-mean clustering. Empirical results from lineal regression model show that possession of Nintendo Switch is negatively associated with switching intention in both segmentations while previous gaming experience on mobile platforms is positively associated with switching intention in both segmentations. It is worth noting that perceived higher gaming performance of traditional platforms is a variable that lower the switching intention only among the Unshakable stayers. In turn, perceived high price of traditional platforms is only positively associated with switching intention among Moderate intentional emigrants, while perceived vendor-related switching costs and previous gaming experience on traditional platforms lower the switching intention in this segmentation. This study contributes to the nascent knowledge body of videogame marketing by creating the first switching empirical model from the traditional videogame platform to the mobile platform, identifying salient factors that positively and negatively affect the videogame platform migration, and giving practitioners of videogame companies useful insights when launching a mobile game project.","tags":["videogames","e-commerce","mobile games"],"title":"What Are the Factors that Drive Traditional Videogame Players to Play Mobile Games?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mónica Cortiñas","Rafael Cabeza","Raquel Chocarro","Arantxa Villanueva"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"24afc11bb3f6b515c87bc6041a3506c7","permalink":"https://monicacortinas.net/en/publication/2019_ecra/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/2019_ecra/","section":"publication","summary":"Currently, consumers display what is known as omnichannel behavior, that is, the combined use of digital and physical channels providing them with multiple points of contact with firms.

This paper focuses on the means consumers use to access information prior to contracting services. It uses two different theoretical perspectives, namely, the economic approach and the psychological approach), and the specific aim is to compare consumers’ choice of source when seeking information prior to contracting services with different levels of search, experience or credence attributes. The modelling technique is mixed regression models, which allow the use of standard errors robust to within-group correlation. Our review of the data from a sample of 492 consumers and nine different services (three for each attribute category) shows that consumers use fewer information sources and show less search intensity when the purchase involves a service with search attributes than when it involves either of the other types. The highest levels of information search intensity and online media usage are found in relation to services with experience attributes. Fewer sources are consulted for purchases involving services with credence qualities than for those involving the other types, but the information obtained has a greater impact on decision making. The information sources most commonly-used are personal contacts and offline media.","tags":["Service sector","Omnichannel","e-commerce"],"title":"Different channels for different services: information sources for services with search, experience and credence attributes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mónica Cortiñas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1529060400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1529060400,"objectID":"3b2155b06a28402a1a1ffe02090a6f22","permalink":"https://monicacortinas.net/en/talk/2018_criptocurrencies/","publishdate":"2018-06-15T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/talk/2018_criptocurrencies/","section":"talk","summary":"Criptomonedas desde el punto de vista del valor para el mercado.","tags":["critocurrency","e-commerce","digital economy"],"title":"Monedas digitales; economía digital e IVA","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Alberto Ibañez Fernandez","Pedro Reinares Lara","Mónica Cortiñas","Gyanendra Singh Sisodia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1525132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525132800,"objectID":"06f5b7251f12d74419c1ede6bfb76dd3","permalink":"https://monicacortinas.net/en/publication/2018_jrcs/","publishdate":"2018-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/2018_jrcs/","section":"publication","summary":"To gain the competitive advantage needed to survive and compete in an environment led by large distribution chains, small-scale retailers need to develop distinctive competencies. This is particularly relevant in the case of retail pharmacies, which are already affected by continuously eroding profit margins, increasing liberalization of the sector and growing competition from new non-pharmaceutical outlets. Against this background, this paper contributes to identifying distinctive competencies with the potential to enhance business performance in retail pharmacies. Using structural equation modelling on a sample of Spanish pharmacies, it also establishes relationships between possession of certain distinctive competencies and success in building a sustainable competitive advantage.","tags":["Distintive Competencies","Strategy","Retailing"],"title":"Distinctive competencies and competency-based management in regulated sectors: A methodological proposal applied to the pharmaceutical retail sector in Spain","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this ongoing project we use eye-tracking techniques to analyze the processes of attention to the website in electronic commerce.\n","date":1524787200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524787200,"objectID":"14b143adc7e9ef8f03e635645cca6bb4","permalink":"https://monicacortinas.net/en/project/eyetracking-visualattention/","publishdate":"2018-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/eyetracking-visualattention/","section":"project","summary":"Analysis of attention to visual stimuli in e-commerce through eye-tracking techniques.","tags":["e-commerce","eye-tracking","purchase path","Current"],"title":"Visual attention in e-commerce","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mónica Cortiñas","Raquel Chocarro","Margarita Elorz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1509098400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509098400,"objectID":"226029b5ecf8a1a064a4f6eb92da9ff3","permalink":"https://monicacortinas.net/en/talk/2017_uv/","publishdate":"2017-10-27T10:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/talk/2017_uv/","section":"talk","summary":"Seminario en el marco del International Seminar: The Retail Challenge from Multichannel to Omnichannel Strategy","tags":["omnichannel","e-commerce"],"title":"Omnichannel Behaviour: Definitions and Covariables","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Mónica Cortiñas","Raquel Chocarro","María Luisa Villanueva"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504875600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504875600,"objectID":"7f4474c8ac1e1da35ec6c9b1c9b6171e","permalink":"https://monicacortinas.net/en/publication/2017_aemark2/","publishdate":"2017-09-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/2017_aemark2/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["services marketing","e-commerce"],"title":"Distintos canales para distintos servicios: Fuentes de Información en Servicios de Búsqueda, Experiencia y Creencia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mónica Cortiñas","Raquel Chocarro","Margarita Elorz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504868400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504868400,"objectID":"9e9a4f647a1cfea62dc74d5948c39f4b","permalink":"https://monicacortinas.net/en/publication/2017_aemark1/","publishdate":"2017-09-08T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/2017_aemark1/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":["omnichannel behavior","e-commerce"],"title":"Omnichannel behavior: Definitions and covariables","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mónica Cortiñas","Raquel Chocarro","Margarita Elorz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504868400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504868400,"objectID":"b86033ab2f075948e844bc2428ec97e6","permalink":"https://monicacortinas.net/en/talk/2017_aemark/","publishdate":"2017-09-08T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/talk/2017_aemark/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["omnichannel","e-commerce","eyetracking"],"title":"Omnichannel behavior: Definitions and covariables","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this ongoing project, in which a doctoral thesis is being developed, we analyze the relationship and the differences between the consumption of video games on mobile platforms and traditional platforms.\n","date":1495843200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1495843200,"objectID":"39ad5df2fae25a796e03bd249bfaf458","permalink":"https://monicacortinas.net/en/project/mobile-games/","publishdate":"2017-05-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/mobile-games/","section":"project","summary":"How do mobile platforms impact the videogame industry?","tags":["Mobile gaming","e-sports","Services marketing","Current"],"title":"Mobile and traditional videogames","type":"project"},{"authors":["Roger R.

They have become a thriving industry in the 21st century. In this paper we enhance understanding of this technology mediated institution as a distribution channel. Furthermore, we show how to measure the impact of the distribution services it provides through the Internet on customer satisfaction and of the latter on economic performance. We rely on the technique of quantile regressions in this endeavor. The latter allows for asymmetries in the response function that have been noted as a major issue to be addressed in the analysis of both customer satisfaction and economic performance variables. Our most important empirical finding is that the distortions introduced by ignoring asymmetries in the response function with respect to customer satisfaction are extremely misleading for managers of private sales clubs.","tags":["Online channels","Distribution services","Quantile regression","Private sales clubs","Customer satisfaction","Intentional loyalty","Retailing"],"title":"Private Sales Clubs: A 21st Century Distribution Channel","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mónica Cortiñas","Raquel Chocarro","Margarita Elorz","José M.

They have type I separability. Distribution services, which are also known as attributes, marketing mix or output variables, are produced, distributed and consumed just as goods or physical products or core services sold directly to consumers at an explicit price. When online settings generate separability of production distribution and consumption of all these distribution services in space and time we have strong type II separability, which has not been identified in the literature. The latter plays an essential role in the emergence, sustainability and sometimes dominance of online channels. It has profound implications for both the demand side and the supply side of firms in online channels. We develop implications of this result with respect to potential maximum levels of these services in electronic channels and for a broad range of other important topics relevant for marketing and economics.","tags":["Distribution services","Separability across space and time","Maximum service limits of channels","Channel choice and management","Online vs. offline retailing"],"title":"Channel Choice in the 21st Century: The Hidden Role of Distribution Services","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roger Betancourt","Mónica Cortiñas","Raquel Chocarro","Margarita Elorz","José Miguel Múgica"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441623600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441623600,"objectID":"2b37783bb74bbb3d84693feb26eef5da","permalink":"https://monicacortinas.net/en/publication/2015_aemark1/","publishdate":"2015-09-07T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/2015_aemark1/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":["omnichannel behavior","e-commerce"],"title":"Creación de sarisfacción y lealtad en nuevos canales: Private Sales Clubs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raquel Chocarro","Mónica Cortiñas","María Luisa Villanueva"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441623600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441623600,"objectID":"3f4e5d0ae8097bb7b79223d5eb31bfff","permalink":"https://monicacortinas.net/en/publication/2015_aemark2/","publishdate":"2015-09-07T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/2015_aemark2/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":["omnichannel behavior","e-commerce"],"title":"Fuentes de información y compra en los servicios de experiencia y creencia","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"\rR Markdown\rThis is an R Markdown document.

Specifically, this paper aims to test for the presence of customer heterogeneity; assess the impact of potential bias when there is no control for heterogeneity; analyse the distinct customer segments that emerge from the empirical estimation of the model; and describe the segments by their demographic and psychological characteristics. Panel data from a survey of online shoppers are used in a post hoc segmentation method, which will enable us to identify segments, while estimating the parameters by means of structural equation models. Three distinct consumer segments emerge. The relative importance of e-loyalty and e-satisfaction is significantly determined by consumers’ shopping styles. This study highlights the need to consider unobserved customer heterogeneity when attempting to explain satisfaction and loyalty development processes in the retail context in general and e-commerce in particular. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first time this approach has been used to analyse the impact of customer heterogeneity on e-satisfaction and e-loyalty.","tags":["Channel management","Buyer behaviour","E-service quality"],"title":"Customer heterogenity in the development of e-loyalty","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"El denominado fenómeno omnicanal ha tenido un crecimiento exponencial en la última década.

One is whether or not basic marketing relationships at the establishment level are robust to a substantial change in the market environment. Another one is whether after this event takes place the marketing relationships for new establishments are the same as those for existing establishments. We rely on two data sets: a survey of gas stations in 1998 in Pamplona, Spain, when prices of gasoline products were fixed by the government; and a similar survey in 2007, when gas retail prices were determined by market participants as a result of the price liberalization law. Briefly put, customer satisfaction and its determinants have a robust, stable relationship with respect to the law’s change in market environment during this nine year period. On the other hand, some aspects of the relation between future patronage intentions and its determinants are substantially altered by the law’s change in market environment.","tags":["Channel management","Buyer behaviour","E-service quality"],"title":"The Impact of Market Environments on Marketing Relationships","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raquel Chocarro","Mónica Cortiñas","María Luisa Villanueva"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1365206400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1365206400,"objectID":"209c2db619de5ce43bb591c52a2d9484","permalink":"https://monicacortinas.net/en/publication/2013_ecra/","publishdate":"2013-04-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/2013_ecra/","section":"publication","summary":"Since the advent and rapid diffusion of the Internet, the subject of consumer channel choice has attracted a large amount of research, mainly focused on the influence of channel, consumer and product category characteristics as its drivers. The interaction between channel choice and the purchase situation has been largely ignored, however. This paper is an attempt to fill this gap by identifying the key purchase situation variables and conducting an experiment to assess their impact on the choice between the traditional retail outlet and the online store. The results show that the key determinants of channel choice relate to time and distance. Distance-to-store and time pressures are among the factors affecting the probability of online purchase. Using a conceptual framework to explore differences in the impact of situational variables across product categories (high/low involvement, search/experience good), we show that distance-to-store has more influence on the likelihood of online purchase in situations involving search goods, while social variables are found to play a role only in the context of high-involvement goods.","tags":["Channel choice","Internet","e-commerce","Situational variables","Experimentation"],"title":"Situational variables in online versus offline channel choice","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raquel Chocarro","Mónica Cortiñas"],"categories":null,"content":"  Outstanding Paper Award 2013   ","date":1361923200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1361923200,"objectID":"a2d6a5853654c310a6563593180d63b0","permalink":"https://monicacortinas.net/en/publication/2013_ijwbr/","publishdate":"2013-02-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/2013_ijwbr/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper aims to examine the way in which consumers integrate experts' opinions into their own evaluations of a selection of red wines. The authors conduct an experiment to measure the influence of experts' opinions in relation to the complexity of the information, the level of consensus between different experts, and the consumer's level of category knowledge. Confirmation is found for the effect of received information on consumers' product evaluations. Variation is found in relation to the consumer's level of category knowledge. Expert ratings have a stronger influence on individuals with low knowledge of the wine category than on those with high knowledge. The level of consensus between experts and the complexity of the information in this case have no effect on the impact of their opinions. This paper takes a deeper look into the effect of “weak‐tie” personal information sources, particularly the opinions of experts regarding wine. Scientific research into the effect of expert judgments on consumer perceptions is still scant and businesses also need to assess the factors underlying its impact, given that the influence of expert judgment can be as crucial as quality to a product's success. The main feature that distinguishes this paper from the previous literature is that it integrates all three moderating effects in a single experiment: level of expert consensus, the complexity of the information provided and the prior knowledge of the consumer.","tags":["Recommendations","Experts' influence","Red wines","Information complexity","Consensus","Consumer response"],"title":"The impact of expert opinion in consumer perception of wines","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this project we explore the distinctive characteristics of agri-food products and the challenges of their commercialization.\n","date":1335484800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1335484800,"objectID":"80434cfac67315438e4b40c5cb5bdf81","permalink":"https://monicacortinas.net/en/project/agricultural-marketing/","publishdate":"2012-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/project/agricultural-marketing/","section":"project","summary":"Distinctive characteristics of the commercialization of products in the agri-food sector","tags":["Agriproducts","Brands","Consumer Experience","Other"],"title":"Agricultural Marketing","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mónica Cortiñas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1332327600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1332327600,"objectID":"0cf13bffb6868bba58c7d361263e7cb7","permalink":"https://monicacortinas.net/en/publication/2012_granada/","publishdate":"2012-03-21T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/2012_granada/","section":"publication","summary":" ","tags":["agriproducts","asparragous"],"title":" Estudio influencia del conocimiento de la categoría de producto.

One of them is a literature on the special role of the consumer in retailing. The other one is the literature on customer satisfaction. This joining of literatures is accomplished by identifying distribution services as outputs of retail firms and fixed inputs into the production functions of consumers and relaxing the standard assumption that the demand for these services is always equal to the supply of these services. The result is a new conceptual framework for the analysis of customer satisfaction in retailing. This framework extends the basic ideas on customer satisfaction developed for manufacturing in a homogeneous single product setting to the heterogeneous multi-product setting relevant for many retailers. The paper illustrates one approach to the implementation of this framework with data for a set of supermarkets in Pamplona, Spain, that measure distribution services by asking consumers questions explicitly identifying these services. The five main categories of distribution services identified by the conceptual framework and measured in the data are economically important and statistically robust determinants of customer satisfaction with supermarkets. These results are obtained controlling for other variables typical of the customer satisfaction literature and measuring customer satisfaction in a manner consistent with that literature. The results are robust to corrections for sample selection and alternative estimation methods. Perhaps our most interesting novel result is that the effect of the determinants of customer satisfaction on future purchase intentions in the supermarket case is different when measured directly in a one stage process than when measured indirectly in a two stage process through the attributes/satisfaction/ purchase intentions chain.","tags":["Brand choice problem","Customer databases","Customer loyalty programs"],"title":"The demand for and the supply of distribution services: A basis for the analysis of customer satisfaction in retailing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roger R.

The questions are: ‘‘do the transactions reflected by the customer cards necessarily reflect the usual purchase behavior ofall customers?’’; and ‘‘do the same customer response models apply equally to regular customers and for the rest of individuals shopping at the store?’’. To answer these questions, a brand choice multinomial logit model choice is applied for the product category chosen (ground coffee). The major findings are that regular price elasticity of all brands in the customer segment is twice what was estimated when studying the total purchases. The effects on brand and type ofcoffee are greater in the customer card-holders segment than in the total purchases.","tags":["Brand choice","Regular customers","Occasional shoppers","Price elasticity","Promotions"],"title":"The Use of a Retail Store Database for Brand Choice Analysis","type":"publication"}]
