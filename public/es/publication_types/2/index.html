    <h2><a href="/es/publication/2019_ecra/">Attention to Online Channels across the Path to Purchase: An Eye-Tracking Study</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Currently, consumers display what is known as omnichannel behavior, that is, the combined use of digital and physical channels providing them with multiple points of contact with firms. We combine the Stimulus-Organism-Response model and the visual attention theory to study how customers' attention to digital channels varies across different purchasing tasks.
We use eye-tracking techniques to observe attention in an experimental setting. The experimental design is composed of four purchasing tasks in four different product categories and measures the attention to the website and time spent on each task in addition to several control variables.
The results show that shoppers attend to more areas of the website for purposes of website exploration than for performing purchase tasks. The most complex and time-consuming task for shoppers is the assessment of purchase options.
The actual purchase and postpurchase tasks require less time and the inspection of fewer areas of interest. Personal involvement also plays a role in determining these patterns by increasing attention to the product area.

    <h2><a href="/es/publication/2018_sij/">Different channels for different services: information sources for services with search, experience and credence attributes</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      A first step in many decision-making processes is a search for information. This paper focuses on the means consumers use to access information prior to contracting services. It uses two different theoretical perspectives, namely, the economic approach and the psychological approach), and the specific aim is to compare consumers’ choice of source when seeking information prior to contracting services with different levels of search, experience or credence attributes. The modelling technique is mixed regression models, which allow the use of standard errors robust to within-group correlation. Our review of the data from a sample of 492 consumers and nine different services (three for each attribute category) shows that consumers use fewer information sources and show less search intensity when the purchase involves a service with search attributes than when it involves either of the other types. The highest levels of information search intensity and online media usage are found in relation to services with experience attributes. Fewer sources are consulted for purchases involving services with credence qualities than for those involving the other types, but the information obtained has a greater impact on decision making. The information sources most commonly-used are personal contacts and offline media.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      To gain the competitive advantage needed to survive and compete in an environment led by large distribution chains, small-scale retailers need to develop distinctive competencies. This is particularly relevant in the case of retail pharmacies, which are already affected by continuously eroding profit margins, increasing liberalization of the sector and growing competition from new non-pharmaceutical outlets. Against this background, this paper contributes to identifying distinctive competencies with the potential to enhance business performance in retail pharmacies. Using structural equation modelling on a sample of Spanish pharmacies, it also establishes relationships between possession of certain distinctive competencies and success in building a sustainable competitive advantage.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Private sales clubs are a novel service institution arising out of the Internet's ability to allow an exclusively online channel to distribute out of season or out of fashion inventories to a large set of customers. They have become a thriving industry in the 21st century. In this paper we enhance understanding of this technology mediated institution as a distribution channel. Furthermore, we show how to measure the impact of the distribution services it provides through the Internet on customer satisfaction and of the latter on economic performance. We rely on the technique of quantile regressions in this endeavor. The latter allows for asymmetries in the response function that have been noted as a major issue to be addressed in the analysis of both customer satisfaction and economic performance variables. Our most important empirical finding is that the distortions introduced by ignoring asymmetries in the response function with respect to customer satisfaction are extremely misleading for managers of private sales clubs.

    <h2><a href="/es/publication/2016_jim/">Channel Choice in the 21st Century: The Hidden Role of Distribution Services</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      A fundamental distinction between goods and services is that in the retailing of goods and some services the costs of production and distribution are clearly separable in a non-arbitrary fashion, usually identified as costs of goods sold. They have type I separability. Distribution services, which are also known as attributes, marketing mix or output variables, are produced, distributed and consumed just as goods or physical products or core services sold directly to consumers at an explicit price. When online settings generate separability of production distribution and consumption of all these distribution services in space and time we have strong type II separability, which has not been identified in the literature. The latter plays an essential role in the emergence, sustainability and sometimes dominance of online channels. It has profound implications for both the demand side and the supply side of firms in online channels. We develop implications of this result with respect to potential maximum levels of these services in electronic channels and for a broad range of other important topics relevant for marketing and economics.

    <h2><a href="/es/publication/2015_jrim/">Customer heterogenity in the development of e-loyalty</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      The purpose of this study is to identify customer-specific differences in a general model of e-loyalty taking into account the existence of unobserved heterogeneity. Specifically, this paper aims to test for the presence of customer heterogeneity; assess the impact of potential bias when there is no control for heterogeneity; analyse the distinct customer segments that emerge from the empirical estimation of the model; and describe the segments by their demographic and psychological characteristics. Panel data from a survey of online shoppers are used in a post hoc segmentation method, which will enable us to identify segments, while estimating the parameters by means of structural equation models. Three distinct consumer segments emerge. The relative importance of e-loyalty and e-satisfaction is significantly determined by consumers’ shopping styles. This study highlights the need to consider unobserved customer heterogeneity when attempting to explain satisfaction and loyalty development processes in the retail context in general and e-commerce in particular. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first time this approach has been used to analyse the impact of customer heterogeneity on e-satisfaction and e-loyalty.

    <h2><a href="/es/publication/2014_ijms/">The Impact of Market Environments on Marketing Relationships</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      This paper addresses empirically two issues. One is whether or not basic marketing relationships at the establishment level are robust to a substantial change in the market environment. Another one is whether after this event takes place the marketing relationships for new establishments are the same as those for existing establishments. We rely on two data sets: a survey of gas stations in 1998 in Pamplona, Spain, when prices of gasoline products were fixed by the government; and a similar survey in 2007, when gas retail prices were determined by market participants as a result of the price liberalization law. Briefly put, customer satisfaction and its determinants have a robust, stable relationship with respect to the law’s change in market environment during this nine year period. On the other hand, some aspects of the relation between future patronage intentions and its determinants are substantially altered by the law’s change in market environment.

    <h2><a href="/es/publication/2013_ecra/">Situational variables in online versus offline channel choice</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Since the advent and rapid diffusion of the Internet, the subject of consumer channel choice has attracted a large amount of research, mainly focused on the influence of channel, consumer and product category characteristics as its drivers. The interaction between channel choice and the purchase situation has been largely ignored, however. This paper is an attempt to fill this gap by identifying the key purchase situation variables and conducting an experiment to assess their impact on the choice between the traditional retail outlet and the online store. The results show that the key determinants of channel choice relate to time and distance. Distance-to-store and time pressures are among the factors affecting the probability of online purchase. Using a conceptual framework to explore differences in the impact of situational variables across product categories (high/low involvement, search/experience good), we show that distance-to-store has more influence on the likelihood of online purchase in situations involving search goods, while social variables are found to play a role only in the context of high-involvement goods.

    <h2><a href="/es/publication/2013_ijwbr/">The impact of expert opinion in consumer perception of wines</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      This paper aims to examine the way in which consumers integrate experts' opinions into their own evaluations of a selection of red wines. The authors conduct an experiment to measure the influence of experts' opinions in relation to the complexity of the information, the level of consensus between different experts, and the consumer's level of category knowledge. Confirmation is found for the effect of received information on consumers' product evaluations. Variation is found in relation to the consumer's level of category knowledge. Expert ratings have a stronger influence on individuals with low knowledge of the wine category than on those with high knowledge. The level of consensus between experts and the complexity of the information in this case have no effect on the impact of their opinions. This paper takes a deeper look into the effect of “weak‐tie” personal information sources, particularly the opinions of experts regarding wine. Scientific research into the effect of expert judgments on consumer perceptions is still scant and businesses also need to assess the factors underlying its impact, given that the influence of expert judgment can be as crucial as quality to a product's success. The main feature that distinguishes this paper from the previous literature is that it integrates all three moderating effects in a single experiment: level of expert consensus, the complexity of the information provided and the prior knowledge of the consumer.

    <div class="article-style">
      
      Intense price competition, diminishing product differentiation and the difficulty of attracting new customers increase the relevance of research into consumer perception of the retail encounter as a key to profitability and firm survival. This paper focuses on satisfaction and loyalty as targets for the food retailer, taking into account the impact made by the behavioural diversity of different customer segments on the satisfaction-loyalty relation. The methodological proposal for this analysis is a structural equation model using post-hoc segmentation to allow for the incorpo- ration and control of customer heterogeneity.
